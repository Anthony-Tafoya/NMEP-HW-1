# NMEP-HW1

Dev notes:
- env.yml has all the dependencies, and .vscode has dev settings like autoformatting with black + pylint


## Nice repository references

Tiny, hackable codebases:
- Karpathy's [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT)
- Bring Your Own Latent ([BYOL](https://github.com/sthalles/PyTorch-BYOL))
- Kaiming's [Masked Autoencoders](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae) (absolutely superb for submitit, helpful for slurm)
- Karpathy's [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) (slightly more structure but enough to train large models)
- [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl), nice for RL... obviously


Medium sized repositories with good abstractions (actual folder breakdowns):
- Berkeley's [nerfstudio](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio)
- Microsoft [Swin Transformer](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer)

Larger codebases that are decent:
- Facebook's [PySlowFast](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast)
